## New Features

This release does not introduce new features.

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where deplect rapidly in shared cockpit.
- Fixed an issue where engine 2 would not shut down for network (or recorded) airplanes.

## Limitations
The `FSX` and `P3D` variants are built for the x86 (32bit) architecture. Since the Microsoft.ML package does not currently offer a x86 variant, the AI-enchanced model matching is not included for `FSX` or `P3D`.

## Known Issues
> [!WARNING]
> The FSX and XPLANE variants are built in a similar fashion like the original JoinFS. The XPLANE vaiant was tested very briefly, since I only have the demo version of XPLANE. Please report any issues you find with these variants.
> If you want to help with testing or development of these variants, please contact me.
