## New Features

- Added support for 8.33kHz channel separation on the COM frequencies. Frequencies are now displayed in the format `XXX.XXX` (e.g., `123.505`).

## Bug Fixes

- 

## Limitations

The COM1/2 channel with 8.33kHz separation is displayed correctly only if the other pilots use joinfs version 26.4 or later. The previous versions of joinfs do not support 8.33kHz separation and will broadcast the COM frequencies in the format `XXX.XX` (e.g., `123.50`).

## Known Issues

- Some XPLANE models appear incomplete (when the model has a space in the filenames of the model data).
- When moving the timeline of a recording in XPLANE, the recorded aircraft disappears.
- When in XPLANE an aircraft model is substituted, the new model is displayed in the center of gravity of the original model. If the replacement model is smaller than the original model, it may appear to be floating in the air. If the replacement model is larger than the original model, it may appear to be embedded in the ground.
